Driver fatigue and drowsiness contribute to approximately 36% of road accidents globally, often resulting in severe injuries and fatalities. Extended periods of driving without adequate rest reduce alertness, slow reaction times, and impair judgment, thereby increasing the likelihood of collisions. This project aims to develop a real-time Fatigue and Drowsiness Detection and Alert System to continuously monitor drivers and detect early signs of fatigue. Using computer vision techniques such as image recognition, object detection, and facial landmark analysis, the system evaluates indicators like eye blinking rate and yawning frequency to assess a driver's alertness. Upon detecting signs of fatigue, it activates an alert mechanism—such as an audible alarm or dashboard warning—to prompt the driver to take corrective action. The need for this system is underscored by the limitations of traditional self-assessment methods, which often fail due to driver underestimation of their fatigue. This system provides a proactive, automated solution to enhance road safety. The target population includes commercial, long-distance, and private vehicle drivers. Data collection is conducted through real-time video in both simulated and real-world driving environments. The detection model is implemented using Python and Dlib, leveraging facial recognition to extract and process video frames. The system’s effectiveness is evaluated using accuracy, precision-recall metrics, and real-time performance under varying lighting and driving conditions. By integrating AI-powered monitoring and alert mechanisms, this system contributes to reducing fatigue-related accidents and promoting safer driving practices.
